When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to collaborate on a project with a team or share my creations with the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be changes that you don't want to use or there might be a buggy commit sitting on the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
You use a fork on GitHub as an easy way to copy another project so you can make your own changes. You use clone to copy the contents of a repository onto another drive (usually from a remote to a local directory). You use a branch if you want to split from the main code to try something experimental without breaking the project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So you can tell if you're out of date.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
SVN! Or just emailing files or something really annoying. It would be easier to not learn all the complicated merge/branch commands. But harder to actually have version control
